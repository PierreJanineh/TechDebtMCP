## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

#### SwiftUI-Specific Technical Debt Analysis (Issue #58)
- **14 comprehensive SwiftUI checks** across 2 phases
- **Phase 1 - Core SwiftUI Checks (9 checks):**
  - Excessive @State variables detection (>5 per view)
  - @ObservedObject initialization misuse detection
  - @Environment value force unwrap detection
  - Combine pipeline circular reference detection ([weak self] validation)
  - Missing Timer cleanup in onDisappear
  - Missing Task cancellation in async operations
  - UI updates on background threads detection
  - Dynamic list missing .id() modifiers
  - Expensive calculations in view body

- **Phase 2 - Advanced SwiftUI Patterns (5 checks):**
  - AnyView type erasure detection
  - Deprecated NavigationLink patterns
  - GeometryReader root-level misuse
  - Retain cycles in SwiftUI closures
  - Deep view nesting detection (>6 levels)

#### GitHub Packages Support
